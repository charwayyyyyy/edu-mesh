# EduMesh Micro-Frontend Architecture

## Overview

The EduMesh platform uses a micro-frontend architecture to enable independent development, deployment, and scaling of different parts of the application. This approach allows different teams to work on separate features without tight coupling, while providing a seamless experience to the end user.

## Key Components

### Core Infrastructure

- **index.ts**: Defines the micro-frontend registry and core utilities for loading and managing micro-frontends.
- **MicroFrontendContainer.tsx**: Provides a consistent layout and communication context for all micro-frontends.
- **MicroFrontendLoader.tsx**: Dynamically loads and renders micro-frontends based on the route.
- **MicroFrontendRegistry.tsx**: Displays all available micro-frontends that the user has permission to access.

### Individual Micro-Frontends

- **JobBoardMFE.tsx**: Job board feature for browsing and applying to job opportunities.
- **MentorshipMFE.tsx**: Mentorship feature for connecting mentors and mentees.
- **SkillExchangeMFE.tsx**: Skill exchange feature for trading skills with other users.

## Architecture

### Communication Patterns

Micro-frontends can communicate with each other through several mechanisms:

1. **Context API**: The `MicroFrontendContext` provides a shared context for all micro-frontends.
2. **Public API Registration**: Each micro-frontend can register a public API that other micro-frontends can access.
3. **Event System**: Micro-frontends can broadcast and subscribe to events for loosely coupled communication.
4. **Global State**: Shared state is managed through Zustand stores accessible to all micro-frontends.

### Routing

Routing is handled at two levels:

1. **Main Application**: Routes to the correct micro-frontend based on the URL.
2. **Within Micro-Frontends**: Each micro-frontend can have its own internal routing.

## Usage

### Adding a New Micro-Frontend

1. Create a new file named `[FeatureName]MFE.tsx` in the micro-frontends directory.
2. Implement the micro-frontend component with its own state, UI, and business logic.
3. Register the micro-frontend in the `microFrontends` array in `index.ts`.

```typescript
// Example registration in index.ts
export const microFrontends: MicroFrontend[] = [
  // ... existing micro-frontends
  {
    id: 'new-feature',
    name: 'New Feature',
    description: 'Description of the new feature',
    entryPoint: './NewFeatureMFE',
    route: '/new-feature',
    version: '1.0.0',
    team: 'Team Name',
  },
];
```

### Accessing the Micro-Frontend Context

```typescript
import { useMicroFrontendContext } from './MicroFrontendContainer';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { broadcastEvent, subscribeToEvent } = useMicroFrontendContext();
  
  // Use the context methods
  broadcastEvent('some-event', { data: 'value' });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = subscribeToEvent('other-event', (data) => {
      console.log('Received event data:', data);
    });
    
    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);
  
  // ...
};
```

### Accessing Another Micro-Frontend's API

```typescript
import { useMicroFrontendContext } from './MicroFrontendContainer';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { getMFEApi } = useMicroFrontendContext();
  
  const handleClick = () => {
    const jobBoardApi = getMFEApi('job-board');
    if (jobBoardApi) {
      jobBoardApi.refreshJobs();
    }
  };
  
  // ...
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Encapsulation**: Keep micro-frontend internals encapsulated and only expose necessary APIs.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Use events for communication when direct API calls aren't necessary.
3. **Consistent UI**: Follow the design system to ensure a consistent user experience.
4. **Performance**: Lazy load micro-frontends to improve initial load time.
5. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to prevent one micro-frontend from crashing others.
6. **Testing**: Test each micro-frontend in isolation and as part of the integrated application.

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Each team can develop their micro-frontend independently.
2. **Integration Testing**: Regularly integrate and test all micro-frontends together.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy micro-frontends independently or as part of the main application.

## Future Enhancements

- Module federation for truly independent deployment
- Versioning and backward compatibility for micro-frontend APIs
- Performance monitoring for individual micro-frontends
- A/B testing at the micro-frontend level
